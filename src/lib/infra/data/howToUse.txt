1. Globally install the migrate-mongo node module
    npm install -g migrate-mongo

2. Create a new migration
    - cd into the "infra/migrations" folder
    - Run the command, 
    
    ```
    migrate-mongo create (name or description here)
    ```

    - A new file will be created in the data folder
    - Edit the file, with up function being the changes you wish to change
    - And down function reverting the changes (if possible)

3. Run a migration
    - To check which migrations are applied, run migrate-mongo status
    - Any migrations with the status "PENDING" will run with the command, 
        "$ migrate-mongo up", or 
        "$ migrate-mongo down"
    - Running migrate-mongo up will run the up functions, and migrate-mongo down will run the down functions
    - If an error occurs, it will stop the script and won't continue with anymore pending migrations
    - When a up migration is completed, it will state the time of use in the Applied At box in status
    - When reverted with a down migration, the status of it will return to "PENDING"
